# Membership Inference Attack
# Analyzing the Vulnerability of Machine Learning Models against Membership Inference Attacks

In this project, we are implementing the membership inference attacks on a custom-designed neural network model built on the Fashion MNIST image dataset. For the implementation of this attack, we are following the Shadow Model Training technique proposed by Shokri et al.
